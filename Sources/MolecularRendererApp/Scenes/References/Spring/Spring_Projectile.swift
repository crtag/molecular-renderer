// Shape the projectile so that landing disperses as little vdW energy as
// possible (don't want it to take the ring with it!). Make it poke into the
// four housings sticking out of the top, and perfectly align the trajectory to
// make that happen. Use the crystolecule assembly from the springboard to
// measure where the protrusions should be placed.
